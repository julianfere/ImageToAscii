# ImageToAscii
    It's a little program that transforms a photo to ascii art and saves it in a png

## How to use
------

- Clone the repo

- ` cd ImageToAscii`

- `python3 main.py`

- Select your file (jpg,png,jpeg,etc)

- Decide between save in a txt file or a png file

> It will generate a out folder with the exported files
    
- EXPERIMENT! 

      At this moment there are 11 levels of gray reprecented in ascii chars
      ['@', '.', ':', ';','+', '*', '?', '%', '$', '#', ' ']
      Brighter                                          Darker
      Usually the order is inverted but since the png has a dark
      background i decided to invert the order and it looks fine
